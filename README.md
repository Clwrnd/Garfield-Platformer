# Garfield Platformer Game
### State of the projet : ðŸ”¨ In progress

Here is a little platformer game I've made myself  about the universe of Garfield. 

You can find the detailled specifications of this games in the wiki asssociated with this repository along with other informations : https://github.com/Clwrnd/Platformer-Game/wiki.


In order to realise this project I've been mainly inspired by an online course on Game Programming in C++. Here are the credits.

## Credits
The idea for this project is originally an Assignement of an online course on Game Programming in C++ teach by the Associate Professor **Dave Churchill**. 

The reference of the course is **COMP 4300, Memorial University, CANADA**. 

Here is the link to the online course on Youtube (episode of the assignment):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5CXXWbaDlc&list=PL_xRyXins848nDj2v-TJYahzvs-XW9sVV&index=11.

I've made modification and additions to the original version of the assignement requirements but it's mainly inspired from there.
